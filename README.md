A read-only locator and extraction library for Quora questions and answers.

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/open-source-bluurr-io/quora-loader-project/_apis/build/status/bluurr.quora-loader?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/open-source-bluurr-io/quora-loader-project/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=master)

## Getting Started
This library allows you to login, search and retrieve answers for a question. As no public API is provided by the Quora platform at this current time, the library uses the Selenium framework to retrieve the data from the Quora platform.

### Prerequisite
The library requires the following minimum versions
1. Java 8
2. Maven 3 or higher
3. Docker (For Testing Only)

#### Selenium

Selenium testing is performed within Docker using the Chrome Selenium image. 

To enable headless mode: `-Dwebdriver.headless={true|false}`
To enable recording output: `-Dcontainer.record={true|false}`

### Usage
Below is an example of how to login, search and load back a question.
```Java
/** Set-up Chrome driver **/
BotExtra.setDriver(new ChromeDriver());

final String QUORA_LOCATION = "https://www.quora.com";

/** Login to the Quora platform **/
DashBoardPage dashboard = LoginPage.open(URI.create(QUORA_LOCATION)).login("{username}", "{password}");

/** Search the term Java on the Quora platform **/
SearchPage searchPage = dashboard.search("Java");

/** Load a summary of up to 10 questions. **/
List<QuestionSummary> questions = searchPage.getQuestions(10);

/** Load a Question and up to 5 answers **/
String location = questions.get(0).getLocation();
Question fullQuestion = QuestionPage.open(location).getQuestion(Answers.limit(5));

/** Clean up **/
BotExtra.closeDriver();
```
### Tests
To run the integration tests the following properties need to be set:
1. `-Dquora.login.username={username}`
2. `-Dquora.login.password={password}`

## Compliance

1. You must use a descriptive user agent header.
2. You must follow robots.txt at all times.
3. Your access must not adversely affect any aspect of the Quora Platformâ€™s functioning.
4. You must make it clear how to contact you, either in your user agent string, or on your website if you have one.

### Note
