A read-only locator and extraction library for Quora questions and answers.

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/open-source-bluurr-io/quora-loader-project/_apis/build/status/bluurr.quora-loader?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/open-source-bluurr-io/quora-loader-project/_build/latest?definitionId=2&branchName=master)

## Getting Started
This library allows you to login, search and retrieve answers for a question. As no public API is provided by the Quora platform at this current time, the library uses the Selenium framework to retrieve the data from the Quora platform.

### Prerequisite
The library requires the following minimum versions
1. Java 11
2. Maven 3 or higher
3. Docker (For Testing Only)

#### Selenium

Selenium testing is performed within Docker using the Chrome Selenium image. 

To enable headless mode: `-Dwebdriver.headless={true|false}`
To enable recording output: `-Dcontainer.record={true|false}`

### Usage
Below is an example of how to login, search and load back a question.


```Java
/** Set-up driver **/

var driver = new ChromeDriver();

var credentials = LoginCredential.builder()
    .username(username)
    .password(password)
    .build();

final String QUORA_LOCATION = "https://www.quora.com";


// Start on login page

LoginPageNavigator navigator = new LoginPageNavigator(BASE_URL, credentials, driver);

// Trigger a login

AuthenticatedNavigator authenticatedNav = navigator.authenticate();

/** Search the term Java on the Quora platform **/

SearchPageNavigator searchNav = authenticatedNav.searchForTerm(SEARCH_TERM);

/** Read the first page of questions **/
List<QuestionSearchResult> questions = searchNav.results().next();

/** Open the question page **/

QuestionSearchResult searchResult = searchNav.firstResult();
QuestionPageNavigator questionNav = authenticatedNav.getQuestionAt(searchResult.getLocation());

/** Read first page of answers **/

List<Answer> answers = questionNav.answers().next();

```
### Tests
To run the integration tests the following properties need to be set:
1. `-Dquora.login.username={username}`
2. `-Dquora.login.password={password}`

## Compliance

As per the Quora terms of service [TOS](https://www.quora.com/about/tos) for machine driven tools - 

1. You must use a descriptive user agent header.
2. You must follow robots.txt at all times.
3. Your access must not adversely affect any aspect of the Quora Platformâ€™s functioning.
4. You must make it clear how to contact you, either in your user agent string, or on your website if you have one.

### Note
The integration tests require the following property to be define `-Dquora.contact={contact_here}` to meet these requirements.
